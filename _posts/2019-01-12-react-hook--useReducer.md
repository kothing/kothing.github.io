`useReducer` 是React提供的一个高级Hook，它不像useEffect、useState、useRef等必须hook一样，没有它我们也可以正常完成需求的开发，但useReducer可以使我们的代码具有更好的可读性、可维护性、可预测性。

- To install the Jekyll site into the directory you're currently in, run `jekyll new` . If the existing directory isn't empty, you can pass the --force option with jekyll new . --force.
- `jekyll new` automatically initiates `bundle install` to install the dependencies required. (If you don't want Bundler to install the gems, use `jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle`.)
- By default, the Jekyll site installed by `jekyll new` uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.
- We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use `jekyll new myblog --blank`
- To learn about other parameters you can include with `jekyll new`, type `jekyll new --help`.
